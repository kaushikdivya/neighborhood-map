# Udacity Neighborhood Map

## Description:
This Project is to show 15 Macy's store locations in the SF bay area using Google Map API.

## Features:
    * The map loads with Google Maps API showing 15 markers with drop animation.
    * Markers can be selected either by clicking them directly or through side nav.
    * On marker selection, the marker keeps bouncing.
    * Infowindow gets closed everytime another marker is clicked.
    * On closing the infowindow, map zooms out to the original size and location.
